# Capstone_Humana
Competition Project using Data Science - Python

## Motivation
Social Determinants of Health are a key component of Humana’s integrated value-based health ecosystem. 60% of what creates health has to do with the interplay between our socio-economic and community environments and lifestyle behaviors.* Humana is seeking that “broader view“ of our members to better understand the whole person and to assist them in new ways towards achieving their best health.

## Problem Statement
Social determinants of health are the conditions in the environments in which people live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning and quality of life outcome and risks. Transportation is one of these determinants. So, our aim is to predict the members who are unable to take full advantages of Humana benefits due to transportation issue.

## Goal
To identify Medicare members most at risk for a Transportation. Challenge and propose solutions for them to overcome this barrier to accessing care and achieving their best health.
